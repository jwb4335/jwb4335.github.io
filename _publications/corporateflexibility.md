We use the COVID shock to study the direct and interactive effects of several forms of corporateflexibility on short- and long-term real business plans. We find that i)workplace flexibility, namelythe ability for employees to work remotely, plays a central role in determining firmsâ€™ employmentplans during the health crisis; ii)investment flexibilityallows firms to increase or decrease capitalspending based on their business prospects in the crisis, with effects shaped by workplace flexi-bility; and iii)financial flexibilitycontributes to stronger employment and investment, in particularwhen fixed costs are high.  While the role of workplace flexibility is new to the COVID crisis,CFOs expect lasting effects for years to come:  high workplace flexibility firms foresee continu-ation of remote work, stronger employment recovery, and shifting away from traditional capitalinvestment, whereas low workplace flexibility firms rely more on automation to replace labor.
