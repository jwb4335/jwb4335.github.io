Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in Finance at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University. I conduct research in corporate finance. I study how shareholders influence executive compensation policy through shareholder voting. I'm also interested in corporate investment (including the determination of discount rates, capital budgeting and project horizons) and corporate flexibility. 

I will be on the 2023/2024 academic job market. 

I have a BA in Philosophy, Politics, Economics and Sociology (PPES) from Trinity College Dublin, and a Master's from the Barcelona School of Economics.

**Abstract.**  How much does shareholder voice via non-binding Say-on-Pay votes impact executive compensation policy? Answering this requires understanding how much the threat of a failed vote impacts the Board of Directors. I estimate a model of CEO compensation with non-binding shareholder approval votes ("Say-on-Pay"). CEO pay is set by the Board, which is asymmetrically informed about the CEO, but biased towards offering a high wage. Shareholders can fail the Say-on-Pay (SOP) and punish the Board for overpayment. The estimation shows that failed votes are perceived as costly by both the Board and shareholders: a failure cost of 2.06% (0.76%) of value for the Board (shareholders) is sufficient to match observed pay levels and failure rates. Empirical evidence suggests the Board cost is a career and reputation concern for directors; for shareholders, it represents a cost to dissenting from the Board on a prominent policy. I construct a counterfactual SOP mechanism which emulates giving a focal shareholder an advisory seat on the Board; this lowers the SOP failure rate, decreases wages and increases firm value.
