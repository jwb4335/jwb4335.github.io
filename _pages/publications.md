**Abstract.**  Managerial influence on the Board of Directors induces an agency problem in the design of executive compensation. I evaluate the role of shareholder voice in disciplining compensation practices by estimating a model of CEO compensation with non-binding shareholder approval votes (Say-on-Pay). The Board sets CEO pay and is biased towards a high wage; shareholders can fail the Say-on-Pay (SOP) and punish the Board for overpayment. Failed votes are perceived as costly by both the Board and shareholders: a cost of 2.06% (0.76%) of value for the Board (shareholders) is sufficient to match the data. SOP thus resembles a costly punishment mechanism and the disciplining effect on compensation increases firm value by 4.6% on average. Empirical evidence suggests the Board cost is a career and reputation concern for directors, and shareholders internalize a cost to dissenting from the Board on a prominent policy. I construct a counterfactual SOP mechanism which emulates giving a focal shareholder an advisory seat on the Board; this lowers the SOP failure rate, decreases wages and further increases firm value.

**Abstract.** During project development, investment costs are endogenously determined through delegated bargaining with counterparties. In surveys, nearly 80% of CFOs report using an elevated hurdle rate, the implications of which we build a model to explore. We show that elevated hurdle rates can convey a bargaining advantage that exceeds the opportunity cost of forgone projects, whether these hurdle rate buffers arise for strategic or non-strategic reasons. Using CFO survey data, we find buffer use is negatively related to the cost of capital and to bargaining power, consistent with our model's predictions, and that realized returns are associated with "beat the hurdle rate benchmark" behavior.

**Abstract.** We use the COVID shock to study the direct and interactive effects of several forms of corporate flexibility on short- and long-term real business plans. We find that i) workplace flexibility, namely the ability for employees to work remotely, plays a central role in determining firmsâ€™ employment plans during the health crisis; ii) investment flexibility allows firms to increase or decrease capital spending based on their business prospects in the crisis, with effects shaped by workplace flexibility; and iii) financial flexibility contributes to stronger employment and investment, in particular when fixed costs are high.  While the role of workplace flexibility is new to the COVID crisis, CFOs expect lasting effects for years to come:  high workplace flexibility firms foresee continuation of remote work, stronger employment recovery, and shifting away from traditional capital investment, whereas low workplace flexibility firms rely more on automation to replace labor.

- **Human Capital and Mobility in the Executive Labor Market<!---({{ site.baseurl }}/files/papers/irr_buffer.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}-->** <br/>

<!---**Abstract.** We pose and estimate an equilibrium job search model of executive careers, allowing for general and firm-specific human capital accumulation, firm heterogeneity, and persistent shocks to executive productivity. Wage growth over the executive's career is decompsed into contributions of  job search and the general and firm-specific components of human capital, both within and between executive positions. Our model can rationalize the observed patterns in hiring and wages of CEOs at US public firms. Firm-specific human capital is key to executive productivity, which helps explains why over 70% of new CEOs are internal promotions. Job search leads to increases in CEO wages as external firms' poaching offers must compensate the CEO for her firm-specific human capital, _even though_ those skills do not transfer across firms.-->
