**Abstract.**  How much does shareholder voice via non-binding Say-on-Pay votes impact executive compensation policy? Answering this requires understanding how much the threat of a failed vote impacts the Board of Directors. I estimate a model of CEO compensation with non-binding shareholder approval votes ("Say-on-Pay"). CEO pay is set by the Board, which is asymmetrically informed about the CEO, but biased towards offering a high wage. Shareholders can fail the Say-on-Pay (SOP) and punish the Board for overpayment. The estimation shows that failed votes are perceived as costly by both the Board and shareholders: a failure cost of 2.06% (0.76%) of value for the Board (shareholders) is sufficient to match observed pay levels and failure rates. Empirical evidence suggests the Board cost is a career and reputation concern for directors; for shareholders, it represents a cost to dissenting from the Board on a prominent policy. I construct a counterfactual SOP mechanism which emulates giving a focal shareholder an advisory seat on the Board; this lowers the SOP failure rate, decreases wages and increases firm value.

**Abstract.** During project development, investment costs are endogenously determined through delegated bargaining with counterparties. In surveys, nearly 80% of CFOs report using an elevated hurdle rate, the implications of which we build a model to explore. We show that elevated hurdle rates can convey a bargaining advantage that exceeds the opportunity cost of forgone projects, whether these hurdle rate buffers arise for strategic or non-strategic reasons. Using CFO survey data, we find buffer use is negatively related to the cost of capital and to bargaining power, consistent with our model's predictions, and that realized returns are associated with "beat the hurdle rate benchmark" behavior.

**Abstract.** We use the COVID shock to study the direct and interactive effects of several forms of corporate flexibility on short- and long-term real business plans. We find that i) workplace flexibility, namely the ability for employees to work remotely, plays a central role in determining firmsâ€™ employment plans during the health crisis; ii) investment flexibility allows firms to increase or decrease capital spending based on their business prospects in the crisis, with effects shaped by workplace flexibility; and iii) financial flexibility contributes to stronger employment and investment, in particular when fixed costs are high.  While the role of workplace flexibility is new to the COVID crisis, CFOs expect lasting effects for years to come:  high workplace flexibility firms foresee continuation of remote work, stronger employment recovery, and shifting away from traditional capital investment, whereas low workplace flexibility firms rely more on automation to replace labor.
